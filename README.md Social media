Domain: Social Media
Goal: Predict whether an article will be popular (shares ≥ 1400) or unpopular.

Project Overview

Mashable collected metadata for ~40,000 online articles. The task is to build a classification model that predicts if an article will go viral based on its content features, sentiment, metadata, keywords, and publishing time.

Dataset

File: OnlineNewsPopularity.csv
Rows: ~39,644
Features: 60+
Includes:

Content statistics (title length, word count, token stats)

Sentiment polarity metrics

Channel/category indicators

Day-of-week publishing flags

Keyword & link metadata

Target: shares

Articles were labeled as:

1 → shares ≥ 1400 (popular)

0 → shares < 1400 (unpopular)

Key Steps
1. Data Exploration

Checked dataset structure using .info(), .describe(), .head()

Built a correlation heatmap

Visualized publishing day vs popularity

Visualized article categories vs popularity distribution

2. Feature Engineering

Log-transform applied to skewed numerical columns

Kept sentiment-related features unchanged

Dropped unsupported columns (URL, timedelta)

3. Train–Test Split
train_test_split(data[features], data['shares'], test_size=0.25, random_state=0)

4. Models Trained

Random Forest Classifier

Bernoulli Naive Bayes

k-Nearest Neighbors

Support Vector Machine (RBF kernel)

Results
Model	Accuracy
Random Forest	0.6649
KNN	0.6070
Naive Bayes	0.5924
SVM (RBF, probability=True)	~0.63 (varies by run)

Conclusion:
Random Forest offers the best performance without heavy tuning.
